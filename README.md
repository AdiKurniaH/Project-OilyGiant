# Project-OilyGiant
Looking for the best place to develop 200 new oil wells

Create a model that will help 
select regions with the highest profit margins by using bootstrapping techniques to 
analyze potential profits and risks. Predict the volume of reserves in new wells and 
select the oil well that has the highest estimated value.  
- Create a function to calculate the final sMAPE value. 
- Training several models using the cross validation (KFold) method to find the best 
final sMAPE value. 
- The models trained are LinearRegression and RandomForestRegression with their 
respective hyperparameter settings
